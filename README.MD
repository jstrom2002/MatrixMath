"MatrixMath" was a numerical computing program 
I wrote back in 2015-2017 to perform certain
calculations (ie finding eigenvalues, numerical
integration) from expressions parsed from the command line. It's still unfinished but has several
useful bits of code I still draw from:
a string parser for functions, 
numerical differentiation/integration headers, and a few others.
