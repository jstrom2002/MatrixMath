"MatrixMath" was a numerical computing program 
I wrote back in 2015 when I was learning how to program. It was designed to perform certain
calculations (ie finding eigenvalues, numerical
integration) from expressions parsed from the command line.   
  
It was never close to being finished but has several
useful bits of code I still draw from:
a string parser for functions, 
numerical differentiation/integration headers, and a few others.
